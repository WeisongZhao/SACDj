/**
 * This class is an abstract class to store a 3D signal in a float array 'data'.
 * The data are store in a 2D array, the first index represents the z direction
 * and the second store a 2D plane in row-major representation.
 * 
 * There are two implementations of this class: RealSignal to store a real volume
 * and ComplexSignal to store a complex signal in interleaving mode.
